---------------------------------------------------------

Feature selection:
Two users are seen as similar if: 
	- activies are similar: word choice, follow behavior
	- They both show high positive interest in a destination user-id(number of actions towards same dest user of which both follow)

Users are likely to follow items who are:
 	- followed by other similar users
 	- similar to other items the user follows (items under same category, with same keywords)
 
Users are more likely to follow than not:
	- if the user follows many many different items
	- if the user follows most recommendations as seen in training
